# Python Calculator

## Introduction

This is a simple Python-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) by entering the calculation in a single line. The program automatically detects the operation and computes the result.

## Features

- Supports four basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Handles errors such as invalid inputs and division by zero.
- User-friendly: Simply enter your calculation in one line (e.g., `8 / 4`), and the calculator will do the rest.
